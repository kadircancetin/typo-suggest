(Gif is older version of typo-suggest but idea is same)

This package is a [[https://www.datamuse.com/api/][datamuse api]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/ispell/][ispell]] backends for fixing typos, getting suggestions and finding the correct word with ~helm~ or ~company-mode~.

* Installation

[[https://melpa.org/#/typo-suggest][file:https://melpa.org/packages/typo-suggest-badge.svg]]

Package is avalible in melpa. So you can install directly =M-x package-install=, =typo-suggest= or if you use use-package =(use-package typo-suggest)=.

* Usage
Use =M-x typo-suggest-helm= for helm completion.

For company mode backend, type =M-x typo-suggest-company-mode=. It will activate or deactivate typo-suggest back-end.

I don't prefer to use it with hook but if you want it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'typo-suggest-company-mode)
#+end_src

* Customization
You can change the backends with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq typo-suggest-default-search-method 'datamuse) ;; beter but online
  (setq typo-suggest-default-search-method 'ispell)   ;; not good but local if you installed ispell
#+end_src

~typo-suggest-suggestion-count~ is for the count of suggestions from backends. You can upper or lower value for the your choice. ~typo-suggest-timeout~ is for the remote server timeout for datamuse backend. If your connection is unstable, you may want to increase this value.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq typo-suggest-suggestion-count 20)
  (setq typo-suggest-timeout 1)
#+end_src

* Common Issues
Company mode or helm mode is _not running asyncronous_. Helm is not frustrating but if the *company-idle-delay* varible is so low, company mode is not fast on ~datamuse~ backend.

* Road Map
- [ ] Google translate integration.
- [X] Ivy integration.
